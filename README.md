**CIFAR-10 GAN with TensorFlow**
This project implements a basic Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate images resembling the CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 50,000 32x32 RGB images across 10 classes (e.g., cars, cats, planes), and this GAN learns to create similar images from random noise.
